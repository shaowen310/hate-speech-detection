# Hate Speech Detection

Twitter hate speech detection.

I build data process utilities and use PyTorch Lightning for supervised training. I aim for the codes to be easily transferable to other projects.

## Dependency

Run the following code.

```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install lightning
```

## Supervised

Working on traditional Word Embedding + LSTM

## Zero-shot
